# Mongo Express & MongoDB in Kubernetes

My main goal is to create a K8s cluster with MongoDB and mongoExpress.
For practice I create a compute engine in Google Cloud Platform and there installed minikube.

### Tasks to be carried out

 * Create Deployment PODs for mongo-express & MongoDB
 * Create Secrets for MongoDB environments & Mongo-Express
 * Create Services for the 2 PODs for communication.
 * ConfigMap for MongoExpress to indicate which database must connects.
 * Ingress for request from broswer mongo-express.
